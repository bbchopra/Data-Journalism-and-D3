# Data-Journalism-and-D3
---
Created a dynamic scatter plot between different variables from the data set using the D3 techniques learned in the class.

- Placed additional labels in the scatter plot and gave them click events so that users can decide which data to display. 
- Animate the transitions of the circles locations as well as the range of the axes and the labels to the left and bottom of the chart. 
- Included state abbreviations in the circles.
